		<h2> postcard feedback for Slyvia Sheng</h1>

		
		<h4> what I enjoyed </h4>
		<li> simplicity of layout </li>
		<li> consistency among all three with the quote placement </li>
	
		<h4> What could be thought more about </h4>
		<li> are you going to move the image down at responsive points?</li>
		<li> Chnage font size? Quote takes up quite a lot of space compared to image and margin</li>
		<li> think about margin consistency (decreasing font size might be easier for you to standardize margin. </li>
		<li> first postcard; “cute” could be a different color bc for the other two, the words seem to pop more  </li>
		<li> second postcard: only highlight one word like the other two</li>
		<li> background gradient consistency. Make the third postcard background lighter at the top like the previous two. </li>
