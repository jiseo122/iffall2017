	Riff Raff started rapping in 2005, making homemade CDs of his rapping over other artists’ beats, and passing them out at various malls in Houston. He credited his early influences being Texas veteran rappers Devin the Dude and Paul Wall. Riff Raff took advantage of social media on Myspace, YouTube and WorldStarHipHop in late 2008, releasing songs, freestyle-videos, and sketch clips, which showcased his talent at slapstick and performance art. He did this with the help of his first talent manager, DB da Boss, whose studio provided recording and video services. DB spoke with LA Weekly about the rapper, saying “He was very driven, very ambitious. You couldn’t deny his work ethic,” going on to say, “Underneath that shell is a very intelligent man.” He looked up to Northside Houston rappers from label Swishahouse, who were blowing up around that time, including Paul Wall, Chamillionaire and Slim Thug. He began doing his hair up in braids popular among “Northsiders” like Slim Thug and shopping for bling at TV Jewelry, a store co-owned by Paul Wall and charismatic Vietnamese immigrant “TV” Johnny Dang, from whom Riff Raff also purchased gold grills. Like many other artists from Houston, Riff Raff also spent much of his time selling CDs at colleges and malls, occasionally alongside other local talent such at Fat Tony and Freestyle Bully.

	In an effort to get on television he went on many auditions, including for a part in a peanut butter commercial intended for a teenager. He and his friend also tried out for P. Diddy’s Making the Band, to no avail. He was so determined to become famous that he flew to Atlanta to try out for MTV’s reality show From G’s to Gents. When he learned that he had made the cast for the program’s second season, before taping had even begun, he immediately got a giant MTV logo tattooed on his neck and adjusted his stage name to “MTV Riff Raff”. Though he was eliminated from the series on the second episode, he left an impression on viewers through his extravagant way of dressing and funny ad-libs.Upon the season’s debut in early 2009 appearance on the show would garner and immediate reaction to him, and catapulted his career.

	The same year actor, comedian and rapper Simon Rex noticed Riff Raff after being shown to him by notable producer The Alchemist. Rex contacted Riff Raff after watching one of his freestyle videos in which he revealed his phone number, and soon enough the two became friends and began recording as Riff Raff and Dirt Nasty. The pair later formed a rap group Three Loco along with comedian Andy Milonakis, increasing Riff Raff’s popularity by tapping into the two celebrities’ fan bases.
