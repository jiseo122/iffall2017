			Following the release of his mixtape Hologram Panda with producer Dame Grease, Riff Raff told MTV that his upcoming Mad Decent second studio album would be titled Riff Raff, The Neon Icon, later shortened to Neon Icon. In February 2013 he told Complex that his second studio album is due out some time during the third quarter of 2013. On June 25, 2013 he released a single titled “Dolce & Gabbana”, produced by DJ Carnage as the first single from Neon Icon, however two days later he announced that the song wouldn’t be included on the album. He was also featured on Far East Movement’s single “The Illest” around the same time. Then on July 12, 2013 he released another non album single titled “Mr. Popular”, and four days later released the music video for the song. In August 2013, Riff Raff announced that he would be releasing a collaboration album with Action Bronson titled Galaxy Gladiators in 2014.


			<br /><br />
			On November 26, 2013 he released the first official single for Neon Icon titled “How To Be the Man” and produced by DJ Mustard. That same month, Riff Raff told Rolling Stone in an interview that leading up to the album’s release he would release various “left-over” tracks from the album’s recording sessions. These notably included the Boi-1da produced “Real Boyz”, featuring rappers OJ da Juiceman and Cap 1, as well as “Suckas Askin’ Questions” with Lil Debbie and “Shoulda Won a Grammy” with Action Bronson. In March 2014, prior to the album’s release, Rolling Stone included the album on their list of “Must-Hear Albums of 2014”. 
			<br /><br />
			Riff Raff announced his intention to release his second studio album Peach Panther on June 1, 2015. The first single, “Spazz Out” featuring production from Travis Barker was released around this time, however the album itself would end up being delayed until 2016. He then released an EP entitled Trench Coat Towers in early November 2015. He extended the release date for Peach Panther several times, with early 2016 being cited on his Instagram as the current date. He was also featured on several singles during 2015, including “Doctor Pepper” with Diplo, CL, and OG Maco, and Flux Pavilion’s single “Who Wants to Rock”. In early 2016 he released the first single from Peach Panther, “Carlos Slim”. The album was eventually released on June 24, 2016.
