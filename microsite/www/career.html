			<p>
	Beginning in 2011, Riff Raff began to be managed by OG Ron C of Swishahouse fame, and moved to Los Angeles. Riff Raff then started releasing more music videos that furthered the artist’s internet fame. Those include songs such as “Jose Canseco”,and “Marc Jacobs”.Then in mid-2011, Riff Raff signed to Soulja Boy’s label S.O.D. Money Gang Inc..Riff Raff joined Soulja Boy’s SODMG label before they met in person; no paperwork was ever signed. However, Riff Raff still wore the imprint’s chain, got its logo tattooed, and again adjusted his stage name, this time to Riff Raff SODMG. They would remain affiliated for around a year, but the label did not push or pay Riff Raff, which would result in him leaving the label. Soulja Boy publicly called Riff Raff a “cokehead” following their split.

	<br /><br />
	Some time before the official split Riff Raff affiliated with producers such as Diplo and Harry Fraud, as well as with Queens rapper Action Bronson. The music video he released for his collaboration with Fraud and Bronson, “Bird on a Wire,” hit the one million plays-mark in roughly two months. “Bird on a Wire” was listed as the 27th best song of 2012 by Complex Music.


	<br /><br />
	In early 2012 he would release music videos for the songs, “Larry Bird”,“Time”and the Chief Keef collaboration “Cuz My Gear”, among others.In April 2012, Riff Raff also announced a collaborative album with Diplo tentatively titled Jody Highroller with guests Skrillex, Usher, Soulja Boy, Gucci Mane, Mystikal and Rusko. In June 2012, Riff Raff released the Summer of Surf mixtape. He signed with Diplo’s label Mad Decent in June 2012. The same year he released the album, The Golden Alien, independently in July[citation needed] which feature tracks produced by MikeChekMusic, “Freeze Dried”, “Obtuse Angle”. It was followed by the release of the mixtape, Birth of an Icon, in August, which was listed by Stereogum as their “Mixtape of the Week.”
